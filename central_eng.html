The steep black canyon walls of the Tibeiren Gorge are adorned with vibrant orange, yellow, and white streaks caused by the long-term oxidation of minerals. The greenery adds a touch of beauty, creating a colorful valley. The rushing water has carved out beautiful curved lines, forming a magnificent and breathtaking gorge. Due to its remote location and difficult access by vehicles, the area remains relatively untouched, maintaining its pristine forest scenery. It truly is a natural masterpiece worth exploring!
