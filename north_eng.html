			      			<br>Taipei Zoo was established in 1914 and was originally located in Yuan Shan, known as "Yuan Shan Zoo." Due to the limitation of space for expansion, it was moved to the Muzha District of Wenshan in 1986 and became the largest zoo in Taiwan, commonly known as "Muzha Zoo." The zoo integrates nature conservation, educational research, and entertainment, making it a popular destination for school outings and outdoor education. In addition to diverse animal habitats, the zoo offers regular penguin feeding shows, koala talks, and thematic activities related to animal care. It is a great place for both children and adults to learn about animals!
