				      			Introduction: 
				      			<br>The Pier-2 Art Center, located next to the harbor, is a warehouse complex that has been transformed into an art district. In addition to vehicles, there is also maritime traffic, creating a lively atmosphere complemented by the sea breeze. The vast expanse of the ocean and sky provides a boundless view that reflects our limitless thoughts and aspirations.
				      			<br>
								The public sector responsible for the operation and management of the district, along with the imaginative artists, each embrace their own dreams. However, in this space, they coordinate their steps, adjust their directions, and strive together towards a shared ideal. Despite the conflicts between administration and art, they become close partners, constructing the image of the Pier-2 Art Center in the hearts of each individual.
