		      		<ul>
		      			<li>
		      				Located:
		      				<br>Sanzhan, Xiulin Township, Hualien County , Taiwan (R.O.C.)

		      			<li>
		      				Introduction: 
		      				<br>Located between Hualien County's Xiulin Township and Heping, the coastal cliff stretches for 22.7 kilometers. Due to tectonic plate collision and continuous uplifting, coupled with abundant rainfall, the overlying rock layers undergo weathering erosion, causing the deep-seated marble and schist to gradually uplift and emerge on the surface. Further influenced by intense coastal erosion, the slope becomes extremely steep, almost vertical. This is the reason behind the formation of the Qingshui Cliff, one of Taiwan's Eight Wonders.
		      				<br>In addition to being the most spectacular scenery along the eastern coast of Hualien, the Qingshui Cliff is also an excellent destination for observing sunrise and sunset. It is a famous scenic spot in Taiwan known for its breathtaking views.

				      			Introduction: 
				      			<br>Qixingtan, also known as Crescent Bay, is the only county-level scenic area in Hualien County, Taiwan. It is located in Beipu Village, Xincheng Township, on the eastern side of Hualien Airport. Qixingtan is a bay that protrudes from the side of Meilun Cape. It used to be the most prosperous place for fixed fishing development in Hualien. In the past, there were scattered lakes in the area, but now Qixingtan generally refers to the area north of Meilun Industrial Zone and Hualien Airport. The coastline stretches for over 20 kilometers, and the beach has a width of approximately 100 meters. Most of the beach consists of pebbles, making Qixingtan the perfect place near Hualien to enjoy the waves and collect stones.

			      			<br>Mainland Provinces Street: It is adorned with red bricks and large red lanterns, creating a nostalgic atmosphere. This section sells a variety of regional dishes from provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Hebei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, adding a diverse range of specialty foods to Dongdamen Night Market.
			      			<br>Ziqiang Night Market: The original Ziqiang Night Market, located on Ziqiang Road in Ji'an Township, closed its doors in November 2015. Some of the vendors from Ziqiang Night Market relocated to Dongdamen Night Market and continued their businesses there in the same year.
